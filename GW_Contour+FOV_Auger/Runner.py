# is not relevant. With this method the three plots are produced and the email
# is sent. If we donÂ´t want all plots or the circular email, we can run the

'''
The Separate_Lobes function in Contour.py compares the average distance between 
points in a lobeand the distance of a new point with respect to the last one, 
when following the ordered points array. So parameter_lobes is just the number 
of times greater than the distance to a new point should be with respect to the
average in order to split and create a new lobe.
 
In GCN_mode it is automatically set to 8, which on average works fine
'''

parameter_lobes = 8

'''
This is the resolution from the CL_Coverage plot, reducing this parameter 
will lead to a better resolution on the plot at the cost of a longer run time.
This parameter is set to 1. automatically in GCN_mode = "yes"
