In response to the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) GW trigger ${name_trigger}
(GCN ${GCN_ID} ,T0= ${GWtime} UTC):

We searched for Ultra High Energy (UHE) neutrinos with energies
above ~ 1e17 eV in data collected with the Surface Detector (SD) of
the Pierre Auger Observatory in a [-500,500] second interval about
the LVK trigger time T0 of ${name_trigger} as well as 1 day after it.

NO events survived the cuts applied to reject the background due to UHE
Cosmic Rays i.e. NO neutrino candidates were identified. The one-day fluence
limit to UHE neutrinos (for a normal operation of the Pierre Auger Observatory) assuming 
an E^-2 differential spectrum is ${limit}


At the time T0 of the GW event, there is a ${fov_prob_first}% probability that the event coincides
with the Field-of-View (FoV) in which the SD of Auger is sensitive to UHE neutrinos 
(corresponding to inclined directions with respect to the vertical relative to the ground). 
The LVK 90% localization region maximally overlapped with the Auger FoV at T0+${t_max} hr 
with a probability of ${maximum} 

The Pierre Auger Observatory is a UHE Cosmic Ray detector
located in the Mendoza Province in Argentina. It consists of an array
of Water Cherenkov detectors spread over a total surface of 3000 km^2
arranged in a triangular grid of 1.5 km side as well as Fluorescence
telescopes and other systems (see 10.1016/j.nima.2015.06.058
for more information). For neutrino searches from GW events with Auger, please refer to:
